# PHP - Connect to a MySql database using the MySqli extension

I made a little script that can connect to a MySql database using the MySql Improved extension.

<br>

# Setup

Change the `$SQLi_host`, `$SQLi_username`, `$SQLi_password`, `$SQLi_database` to your database settings.

Now everything should work.

<br>

# How to use

Place your code at `rule 31`

If you want to get information out of the database, you can select row's. <br>
You get the data by using `$SQLi_row[0]` change the '0' to the number of the row you want to select.
